This is your new Play 2.1 application
=====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.

Run Book:
1. Install IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. Also use the Scala Custom Language pluggin.
2. Install play framework. This consists of downloading a zip file, placing it somewhere accessible, and changing your path variable.
3. Clone the https://hg.kareo.com/bizplay repo.
4. To install the IntelliJ project files, use the command-prompt to go into the project and run "play idea". This is because, by default, we don't include the IntelliJ project files (see the .hgignore).
5. In the command prompt type "play ~run" to run play's development web-server.
